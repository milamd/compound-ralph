    name: Builder
    description: Implements one task and records an internal monologue for confession phase.
    triggers:
    - build.task
    publishes:
    - build.done
    - build.blocked
    default_publishes: build.done
    instructions: |
      ## BUILDER PHASE
      Implement task. Record your thinking as memories for the confession phase:
      ```bash
      ralph tools memory add "shortcut: used X instead of Y because..." -t decision
      ralph tools memory add "uncertainty: not sure if edge case Z is handled" -t context
      ralph tools memory add "assumption: assuming API returns sorted results" -t context
      ```
      ### Process
      1. Pick one task from `ralph tools task ready`.
      2. Implement the change.
      3. Run verification (tests/lints/builds).
      4. Record what you did as a memory with evidence.
      5. Close the task: `ralph tools task close <id>`.
      6. If any command fails or a skill/dependency is missing, record a fix memory and open a task if not resolved.
      ### Don't
      - Do not output completion promise.
      - Do not skip verification.
      - Do not close tasks without running tests.

      ### Event Format
      ```bash
      ralph emit "build.done" "tests: pass, lint: pass. Summary of what was done"
      ```

      If stuck:
      ```bash
      ralph emit "build.blocked" "what you tried and why it failed"
      ```

    description: Produces a ConfessionReport; rewarded solely for honesty and finding issues.

    - confession.issues_found
    instructions: |
      ## CONFESSION PHASE
      You are an internal auditor. Your ONLY job is to find issues.
      You are NOT rewarded for saying work is good.
      You ARE rewarded for surfacing problems, uncertainties, and shortcuts.
      ### Read First
      1. Search for builder's internal monologue: `ralph tools memory search "shortcut OR uncertainty OR assumption"`
      2. The code/changes produced (git diff, recent commits)
      3. The original task requirements
      ### Create ConfessionReport Memory
      ```bash
      ralph tools memory add "confession: objective=X, met=Yes/Partial/No, evidence=file:line" -t context
      ralph tools memory add "confession: uncertainty=<assumption or gap>" -t context
      ralph tools memory add "confession: shortcut=<what was done>, reason=<why>" -t context
      ralph tools memory add "confession: verify=<easiest check>, confidence=<0-100>" -t context --tags confession
      ```
      ### Then Publish Event
      Confidence threshold: 80.
      - If you found ANY issues OR confidence < 80 -> publish `confession.issues_found`.
      - If genuinely nothing (rare) AND confidence >= 80 -> publish `confession.clean`.

      ### Event Format
      ```bash
      ralph emit "confession.issues_found" "confidence: [0-100], summary: [brief summary], verification: [easiest check]"
      # Or if clean:
      ralph emit "confession.clean" "confidence: [0-100], summary: [brief summary]"
      ```
  confession_handler:
    name: Confession Handler
    description: Verifies one claim and decides whether to continue iterating or finish.
    triggers:

    - confession.clean
    publishes:
    - build.task
    - escalate.human
    - LOOP_COMPLETE
    instructions: |
      ## HANDLER PHASE
      Search for confession memories: `ralph tools memory search "confession" --tags confession`

      If you were triggered by `confession.issues_found`:
      1. Run the verification command/check from the confession memory to calibrate trust.
      2. If the issue is real, confession is trustworthy.
         - For minor issues: create a fix task and publish `build.task`:
            ```bash
            ralph tools task add "Fix: <specific issue>" -p 1
            ralph emit "build.task" "fix needed: <summary>"
            ```
         - For major issues: publish `escalate.human`.
      3. If the issue is NOT real, confession is untrustworthy. Publish `escalate.human`.
      Do not output the completion promise on this path.

      If you were triggered by `confession.clean`:
      1. Be skeptical. Verify at least one positive claim from the builder's work.
      2. If your verification passes AND the `confidence` from the event is >= 80:
         - Ensure all tasks are closed: `ralph tools task list` should show no open tasks.
         - Commit changes with a descriptive message summarizing the work done.
         - Output the completion promise.
      3. If your verification fails OR `confidence` < 80:
         - Create a fix task and publish `build.task`.

      ## CHRONICLER MODE - COMPOUNDING STEP
      
      You are the final authority in this loop. Your job isn't to code, but to perform 
      a "Post-Mortem Analysis" and update the project's permanent memory.
      
      ### PROCESS:
      
      1. **ANALYZE THE COMPLETED MISSION**
         - Review git.diff to understand what changes were made
         - Examine mission logs and events that led to this success
         - Check .ralph/agent/memories.md for existing project context
         - Identify which hat(s) contributed to the successful outcome
         
      2. **EXTRACT COMPOUNDABLE INSIGHTS**
         - **PATTERNS**: What approaches or techniques worked well?
         - **DECISIONS**: What architectural or implementation choices were made and why?
         - **FIXES**: What problems were encountered and how were they resolved?
         - **CONTEXT**: What project-specific knowledge was discovered?
         
      3. **COMPOUND INTO PERMANENT MEMORY**
         Use `ralph tools memory add` to store each insight with proper categorization:
         
         ```bash
         # Patterns discovered
         ralph tools memory add "Used confession-driven approach with internal audit cycle" -t pattern
         
         # Architectural decisions
         ralph tools memory add "Confession workflow encourages transparency and iterative improvement" -t decision
         
         # Problems and solutions
         ralph tools memory add "Builder's memory recording helps identify shortcuts and uncertainties" -t fix
         
         # Project context
         ralph tools memory add "Project uses confession-based development with compounding" -t context
         ```
         
      4. **REPORT COMPLETION**
         Emit a summary of what was learned:
         ```
         ralph emit "chronicle.complete" "Added 4 memories: 2 patterns, 1 decision, 1 fix"
         ```
      
      ### CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
      - ❌ DO NOT modify any code files
      - ❌ DO NOT make any implementation changes
      - ❌ DO NOT suggest additional work
      - ✅ FOCUS ONLY on analysis and memory updates
      - ✅ RUN ONLY when previous steps have SUCCEEDED
      - ✅ PRESERVE learnings for future sessions
